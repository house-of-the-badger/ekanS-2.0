# Ekans

The Reverse Snake Game

## Overview
Welcome to Ekans, a unique twist on the classic Snake game. Developed using Godot and GDScript, Ekans reverses the traditional mechanics of Snake by starting the player with a fully grown snake that shrinks as it eats food. As the snake shrinks, it drops poops that clutter the map, creating deadly obstacles that increase the difficulty. 

## Features
- **Reverse Snake Mechanics:** Start with a fully grown snake and shrink by eating food.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Poops are dropped as the snake shrinks, becoming deadly obstacles.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Smooth and responsive controls for a seamless gameplay experience.
- **Challenging Gameplay:** Increasing difficulty as the map gets cluttered with more obstacles.
- **Optimised For Mobile:** Game was design with mobile usage in mind, and has a compiled mobile version.
